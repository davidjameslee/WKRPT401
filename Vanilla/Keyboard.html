                This was a personal project that I wanted to complete for a mostly two reasons. First I wanted to do something that is more hardware related. Being a computer engineer and doing a lot of software related projects and work made me want to expand my horizons a bit. I wanted a way to improve myself and better my soldering skills. I decided an Arduino level project would be more approachable due to my knowledge and skillset. The second reason is that I really enjoy mechanical keyboards. Since I spend a lot of time at a computer, having a nice keyboard really enhances the overall experience. Being able a keyboard that matches my preference of sound/click or lack there of was really appealing. So this had lead me to appreciate keyboards more than most people should. I saw basic concepts and some people making small mechanical keyboards with a few keys for certain video games. I thought it was a really good idea since I would be able to have a portable mechanical keyboard setup to play a platformer and extremely niche rhythm games.

                The parts I used for the build were:
                <ul>
                    <li>Adafruit Pro Trinket</li>
                    <li>Gateron Brown Switches</li>
                    <li>Wooden Box</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The choice of parts is mostly personal preference for my build. I chose the Pro Trinket since it did everything I needed and getting one was easy and inexpensive. The small form factor also allows a wide variety of potential cases. For key switches I chose Gateron Browns. I chose Gateron since they were easy to get and quite well made. The color of the switch usually defines the behavior and is personal preference. The brown switches I chose have a tactile bump, require little force and are quiet as far as key switches go. There are many resources online that do a good job explaining the different key switches.

                The schematic and code are relatively simple for the keyboard. I will try to put them here as well as pictures the next time I get a chance.
